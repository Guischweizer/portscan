### Portscan With Python
 - Currently we are scanning a small list of ports `[21,22,80,332,445,3306,25]`
 - You will be asked to provide a valid IP address or URL
 - The return will be either the OPEN port or a message saying that was not possible to get any open ports

 ## How to
  - Run on your terminal:
    - ```python3 portscan.py```
